# Intrusion Detection and Prevention System using Snort and Fail2ban



## **üìñ Overview**
This project focused on building a lightweight intrusion detection and prevention system using Snort and Fail2Ban in a controlled virtual environment. Snort was configured to monitor network traffic for signature-based attacks, while Fail2Ban was set up to parse logs and automatically block malicious IP addresses. The two tools were integrated into a single logging workflow to provide a multi-layered defense mechanism against brute force, port scanning, and ICMP flood attacks. All simulated and tested using Kali Linux. The setup emulates how open-source tools can be combined to detect and mitigate network threats in real time.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Snort Configuration**

**Step 1: Installation**

Snort was installed on the Ubuntu Server virtual machine to function as a signature-based Intrusion Detection System.

##

After installation, the version of Snort was verified using the snort -V command (Alternative to --version). This confirmed the system was running Snort version 2.9.20, which aligned with the project‚Äôs compatibility requirements.

Configuration continued with editing the /etc/snort/snort.conf file. The HOME_NET variable was set to reflect the IP range of the internal virtual environment (192.168.1.0/24).
##

**Step 2: Custom Snort Rules**

Custom rules were added to local.rules to detect malicious behavior such as ICMP floods, port scans and many more.

## **üîê Fail2Ban Configuration**


**Step 1: Installation**

Fail2Ban was installed and enabled to start on boot.

**Step 2: SSH Brute-Force Protection**

Configured a jail in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local to monitor SSH and ban IPs after 3 failed login attempts.

Summary of Fail2ban Prevention capability

| Attack Type | Source	| Can Fail2Ban Block? |	How? |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|------|
| SSH Brute Force |	var/log/auth.log | Native | Already built-in |
| Port Scanning	| Snort | Yes | Parse Snort alerts |
| Ping Flood (ICMP) |	iptables / syslog |	Yes	| Log + custom jail |

This table highlights Fail2Ban‚Äôs flexibility in blocking different types of attacks by showing the log source, detection method, and whether native or custom configurations are required.

##

**Step 3: Preventing Port Scanning with Fail2Ban**

Snort‚Äôs preprocessor sfPortscan was enabled in snort.conf to detect scanning behavior such as SYN and NULL scans. Once detected, Fail2Ban reads Snort's alerts and bans the offending IP via iptables.


- **Snort Configuration**

Enabled sfPortscan in snort.conf.

**Step 4: Blocking Ping Floods with Fail2Ban**

Since Fail2Ban can‚Äôt parse ICMP directly, iptables was configured to log excessive ping requests:

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 1/second -j LOG --log-prefix "PING FLOOD: "

- **Logging Setup**

Logged frequent ICMP echo-requests with a unique prefix.

ICMP flood logging rule using iptables

- **Fail2Ban Filter & Jail**

Created /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ping-flood.conf to match the log prefix, and /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ping-flood.conf for the jail config.

## **üîó Snort & Fail2Ban Log Integration**

To unify detection and logging, Snort and Fail2Ban were integrated into a single pipeline with persistent service control.

**üìÅ Combined Log System**

A custom script (/usr/local/bin/combine_logs_script.sh) merges:

/var/log/snort/alert

/var/log/fail2ban.log

into a shared file: /var/log/snort_fail2ban.log.

Each entry is tagged by source for easier parsing and analysis.

**üõ†Ô∏è Systemd Service Setup**

A custom systemd service was created to auto-start Snort, Fail2Ban, and the log combiner at boot.

Terminal output confirming the custom IDPS service is enabled and running.

## **üß™ Attack Simulations**

To validate the effectiveness of Snort and Fail2Ban, three attacks were simulated from a Kali Linux VM targeting an Ubuntu server:


**üîê 1. Brute Force SSH Attack**

Multiple failed SSH logins were attempted from Kali to the target Ubuntu system (192.168.1.147).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6536213-62a3-4413-845a-049f48ad6e7c)

Fail2Ban monitored /var/log/auth.log and banned the IP after exceeding the retry threshold.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b52a29-990f-49f2-98e7-9da99da12097)

A follow-up SSH attempt returned Connection refused, confirming the IP was blocked.

##

**üåê 2. Port Scanning with Nmap**

An Nmap SYN scan was used to probe open ports on the target machine (where Snort and Fail2Ban were installed): nmap -sS 192.168.1.147
Alternatively, a more aggressive scan was also used: nmap -sS -p- -T4 192.168.1.147 

![Screenshot 2025-04-20 015058](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4a727e5-2057-4f02-a277-fde90d9d86d4)

Snort detected the scan and logged it.

![Screenshot 2025-04-20 020813](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96c3e738-4bff-4ed0-9b61-0bc6b12e0cbe)

Fail2Ban parsed the alert and banned the attacker‚Äôs IP.

![Screenshot 2025-04-20 014816](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd387976-d907-4f3f-9aa4-d090d960aa86)

After the bantime (600s), the IP was unbanned.

##

**üì∂ 3. ICMP Ping Flood**

A flood of ICMP echo requests was sent using:

ping -f -i 0.01 192.168.1.147

![Screenshot 2025-04-20 033800](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fabea95a-757c-4e22-a9b9-5d86f865e14a)

Fail2Ban detected the pattern and banned the IP under the ping-flood jail.

![Screenshot 2025-04-20 033915](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1e41e8e-12be-48ba-ae74-76d1000b0f73)

Ban lifted automatically after 10 minutes.
